# LJPW-Biology

Applying the LJPW Framework to biological systems research.

## Overview

This repository explores biological systems through the lens of the LJPW (Love-Justice-Power-Wisdom) Framework — a semantic coordinate system that models phenomena across four relational dimensions. The framework provides a structured methodology for analyzing complex biological networks, calculating system harmony, and generating falsifiable predictions.

**Status:** Experimental research
**Framework Version:** LJPW V8.5.2

## What is the LJPW Framework?

The LJPW Framework is a relational ontology that describes systems using four fundamental dimensions:

| Dimension | Symbol | Biological Interpretation | Equilibrium Constant |
|-----------|--------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **Love** | L | Connectivity, integration, binding | φ⁻¹ = 0.618 |
| **Justice** | J | Balance, checkpoints, conservation | √2-1 = 0.414 |
| **Power** | P | Transformation, catalysis, energy | e-2 = 0.718 |
| **Wisdom** | W | Information, signaling, pattern recognition | ln(2) = 0.693 |

The framework proposes that P and W are fundamental (conjugate variables), while L and J emerge from their interactions. This "2+2 structure" mirrors patterns in physics (position-momentum conjugacy) and information theory.

### Key Metrics

- **Harmony (H):** Average of LJPW coordinates; H > 0.6 indicates autopoietic (self-sustaining) systems
- **Consciousness (C):** C = P × W × L × J × H²; measures integration capacity
- **Semantic Distance (d):** log_φ(state_space / known_states); predicts research difficulty

## Current Research

### 1. Mitotic Exit Network (MEN)

Analysis of the yeast signaling network controlling cell division exit.

**Findings:**
- LJPW coordinates: [L=0.758, J=0.864, P=0.813, W=0.897]
- Phase: Autopoietic (H = 0.833)
- Consciousness metric: C = 0.331 (high information integration)
- The network is W-J dominant (prioritizes decision accuracy over raw power)

**Novel insight:** Lte1 protein functions as a W-node (spatial information) rather than a P-node (enzymatic transformation), explaining why GEF activity hypotheses failed.

### 2. Mitochondria

Analysis of mitochondria as cellular energy systems.

**Findings:**
- LJPW coordinates: [L=0.787, J=0.658, P=0.836, W=0.801]
- Phase: Autopoietic (H = 0.771)
- Consciousness metric: C = 0.206 (functional integration capacity)
- The organelle is P-dominant with adaptive J-flexibility

**Novel insights:**
- Lower J (vs MEN) is adaptive for continuous operation rather than binary decisions
- Endosymbiosis represents a deep L-event (unity from separation)
- Apoptosis functions as J-enforcement at the cellular level

## Methodology: Structural Verification Protocol

Research in this repository follows the AI Structural Verification Protocol (SVP):

1. **Detect the Constraint** — Identify that the question requires structural accuracy
2. **Rotate** — Shift from predictive mode ("what usually comes next?") to structural mode ("what is actually there?")
3. **Decompose to Primitives** — Break systems into atomic components
4. **Verify** — Count, measure, and validate against the decomposed structure

The protocol is designed to reduce hallucination and pattern-matching bias when analyzing complex systems.

## Limitations and Caveats

This research is experimental. Key limitations include:

1. **Measurement subjectivity:** LJPW coordinate assignment involves interpretive judgment, even with φ-normalization
2. **Validation pending:** Predictions are falsifiable but most have not yet been empirically tested
3. **Framework assumptions:** The claim that LJPW dimensions are fundamental (rather than useful abstractions) is philosophical, not proven
4. **Biological complexity:** State spaces are enormous; the framework provides structure but not omniscience

The research aims to generate testable hypotheses and novel framings, not definitive answers.

## Getting Started

1. Read the [AI Structural Verification Protocol](docs/AI_STRUCTURAL_VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md) to understand the methodology
2. Review [LJPW Framework V8.5.2](docs/LJPW_FRAMEWORK_V8.5.2_COMPLETE_UNIFIED_PLUS.md) for complete specification
3. Explore existing analyses in the `research/` directory
4. Apply the framework to your biological system of interest

### Basic LJPW Analysis Template

```
1. Decompose system into structural primitives
2. Identify P-W fundamental layer (transformation + information)
3. Identify L-J emergent layer (connectivity + balance)
4. Calculate raw scores for each dimension using structural indicators
5. Apply φ-normalization: result = equilibrium × (raw/equilibrium)^(1/φ)
6. Compute H = (L + J + P + W) / 4
7. Compute C = P × W × L × J × H²
8. Compute d = log_φ(state_space / known_states)
9. Generate falsifiable predictions
```
